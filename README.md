These are my dotfiles.  There are many like them, but these are mine.

They're set up for bash, emacs, rvm/ruby, git, and seem to
work on Linux (Ubuntu and Mint) and Mac OS X.  Parts of them probably
originated on a 4.2bsd VAX and a 3b2 running System V in the early
80s, but like Abe Lincoln's axe, the handle has been replaced three
times and the head twice.

To install, type "make" The existing dotfiles will be set aside and
symbolic links will be created that point to these dotfiles.  So keep
them checked out.  "make clean" will delete the set aside files, plus
any emacs cruft in this directory.
