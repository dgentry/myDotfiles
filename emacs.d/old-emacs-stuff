;Now, the next time you start Gnus, this back end will be queried for
;new articles, and it will move all the messages in your spool file to
;its directory, which is `~/Mail/' by default. The new group that will
;be created (`mail.misc') will be subscribed, and you can read it like
;any other group.

;You will probably want to split the mail into several groups, though:

(setq nnmail-split-methods
      '(("junk" "^From:.*Lars Ingebrigtsen")
        ("crazy" "^Subject:.*die\\|^Organization:.*flabby")
        ("other" "")))
